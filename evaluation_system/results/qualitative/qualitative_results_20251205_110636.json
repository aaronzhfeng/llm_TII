Both are formed by light reflecting off water molecules, but stars are more visible and have greater brightness than rainbows.\nHow do you see",

The shorter wavelengths (such as green and purple) are less visible and make up the other colors, such as black and white. The colors of the sky change depending on the season and time of day, but generally remain blue. In some cases, the sky can become green or red due to dust particles in the air",
